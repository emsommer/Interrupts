Embedded Systems Programming Lab 9

This lab focused on the usage of interrupts over polling loops. 

This lab was essentially the same as lab 8, except the first timer controlled some LEDs, making them blink every second (this is instead of displaying the timer on the seven seg displays).

The second timer was the same, and acted as a stopwatch that diplsayed the amount of time passed in miliseconds on the seven seg displays when buttons were pressed.
